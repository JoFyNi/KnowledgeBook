<h1>Bubblesort</h1>

<p>Bubblesort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>Let's consider the following unsorted list: [5, 2, 9, 1, 5]</p>

<pre>
Step 1: [2, 5, 9, 1, 5]  (5 and 2 are swapped)
Step 2: [2, 5, 1, 9, 5]  (9 and 1 are swapped)
Step 3: [2, 5, 1, 5, 9]  (9 and 5 are swapped)
Step 4: [2, 1, 5, 5, 9]  (5 and 1 are swapped)
Step 5: [1, 2, 5, 5, 9]  (2 and 1 are swapped)
</pre>

<p>The list is now sorted: [1, 2, 5, 5, 9]</p>

<h2>Pseudocode</h2>

<pre>
procedure bubbleSort( A : list of sortable items )
    n = length(A)
    repeat
        swapped = false
        for i = 1 to n-1 inclusive do
            if A[i-1] > A[i] then
                swap(A[i-1], A[i])
                swapped = true
            end if
        end for
    until not swapped
end procedure
</pre>

<p>As you can see, the Bubblesort algorithm has a time complexity of O(n<sup>2</sup>) in worst case and best case scenario. This makes it inefficient for large lists. However, it can be useful for small lists or lists that are already partially sorted.</p>

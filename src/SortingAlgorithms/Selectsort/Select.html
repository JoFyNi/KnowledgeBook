<h1>Selectsort</h1>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Consider the following list of integers: [4, 6, 1, 3, 5, 2]</p>
<p>After applying the Selectsort algorithm, the list would be sorted as: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]</p>
<h2>Algorithm</h2>
<pre>
procedure selectSort(arr)
    for i = 0 to arr.length - 1
        for j = i+1 to arr.length - 1
            if (arr[j] < arr[i])
                swap(arr[i], arr[j])
</pre>
<p>Selectsort is a simple sorting algorithm that compares all elements in the array and swap them if the element on the right is smaller than the one on the left. This process is repeated for all elements of the array. It selects the smallest element of the array and swap it with the first element,then selects the second smallest element and swap it with second element and so on. It's a simple and slow sorting algorithm. It's time complexity O(n^2) in worst case and average case as well. It is not a recommended method for sorting a large set of data but can be used as a simple alternative in small data sets. It is not a stable sorting algorithm which means the relative position of elements with the same value is not preserved during the sorting process.</p>

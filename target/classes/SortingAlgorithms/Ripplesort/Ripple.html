<h1>Ripplesort</h1>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Consider the following list of integers: [4, 6, 1, 3, 5, 2]</p>
<p>After applying the Ripplesort algorithm, the list would be sorted as: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]</p>
<h2>Algorithm</h2>
<pre>
procedure rippleSort(arr)
    for i = 0 to arr.length - 1
        for j = i to arr.length - 1
            if (arr[i] > arr[j])
                swap(arr[i], arr[j])
</pre>
<p>Ripplesort is a simple sorting algorithm that compares all elements in the array and swap them if the element on the left is bigger than the one on the right. This process is repeated for all elements of the array. It compares all elements one by one and sort them based on a comparison operation.It's a simple and slow sorting algorithm. It's time complexity O(n^2) in worst case and average case as well. It is not a recommended method for sorting a large set of data but can be used as a simple alternative in small data sets. It is a stable sorting algorithm which means the relative position of equal elements will remain the same in the final sorted array.</p>

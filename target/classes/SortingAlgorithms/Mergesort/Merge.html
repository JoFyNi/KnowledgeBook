<h1>MergeSort</h1>

<p>MergeSort is a divide and conquer algorithm that sorts an array by repeatedly dividing it in half and then merging the sorted halves back together. It divides the array in half until each sub-array has only one element and then compares and merges adjacent sub-arrays back together until the entire array is sorted.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>Let's consider the following unsorted list: [38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10]</p>

<pre>
Step 1: [38, 27] [43, 3] [9, 82] [10]
Step 2: [27, 38] [3, 43] [9, 82] [10]
Step 3: [3, 27, 38, 43] [9, 10, 82]
Step 4: [3, 9, 10, 27, 38, 43, 82]
</pre>

<p>The list is now sorted: [3, 9, 10, 27, 38, 43, 82]</p>

<h2>Pseudocode</h2>

<pre>
procedure mergeSort(arr, l, r)
  if (l < r)
    m = l+(r-l)/2
    mergeSort(arr, l, m)
    mergeSort(arr, m+1, r)
    merge(arr, l, m, r)

procedure merge(arr, l, m, r)
    n1 = m - l + 1
    n2 = r - m
    L = [n1+1]
    R = [n2+1]
    for i = 0 to n1-1
        L[i] = arr[l + i]
    for j = 0 to n2-1
        R[j] = arr[m + 1+ j]
    i = 0; j = 0; k = l;
    while i < n1 and j < n2
        if L[i] <= R[j]
            arr[k] = L[i]
            i = i + 1
        else
            arr[k] = R[j]
            j = j + 1
        k = k + 1
    while i < n1
        arr[k] = L[i]
        i = i + 1
        k = k + 1
    while j < n2arr[k] = R[j]
        j = j + 1
        k = k + 1
</pre>
<p>This pseudocode is a high-level representation of the MergeSort algorithm. It starts by dividing the array in half by recursively calling the mergeSort() function on the left and right halves of the array. Once the array has been divided into single element arrays, the merge() function is called to combine the sorted halves back together in the correct order.</p>
<p>The merge() function takes the left and right halves of the array, as well as the lower and upper bounds, as its arguments. It creates two new arrays, L and R, that hold the elements of the left and right halves, respectively. It then uses a while loop to compare and merge the elements of L and R back into the original array in sorted order.</p>

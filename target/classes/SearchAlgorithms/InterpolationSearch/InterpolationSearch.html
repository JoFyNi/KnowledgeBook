<h1>Interpolation Search</h1>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Consider the following sorted list of integers: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]</p>
<p>We want to find the index of the number 14 in this list. Using the interpolation search algorithm, we would:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Determine the position of 14 in the list by interpolating its location based on the low and high bounds of the list and the values of the key and the bounds. This position turns out to be 6.</li>
    <li>Compare the element at position 6 to the key, 14. Since they are equal, we have found the index of the key and return it (6).</li>
</ol>
<h2>Algorithm</h2>
<pre>
    function interpolation_search(arr, key)
        low = 0
        high = len(arr) - 1
        while low <= high and key >= arr[low] and key <= arr[high]:
            pos = low + ((high - low) / (arr[high] - arr[low])) * (key - arr[low])
            if arr[pos] == key:
                return pos
            if arr[pos] < key:
                low = pos + 1
            else:
                high = pos - 1
        return -1
    </pre>
<p>Interpolation search is a search algorithm for sorted arrays, it works by determining the position of the key in the list by interpolating its location based on the low and high bounds of the list and the values of the key and the bounds. The interpolation is done using a formula that estimates the position of the key based on the values of the bounds and the key. It is efficient when the elements in the list are uniformly distributed. However, when the elements are not uniformly distributed, its time complexity can degrade to O(n). It is also efficient for large data sets but can be ineffective in small data sets or when the distribution of the data is skewed. </p>

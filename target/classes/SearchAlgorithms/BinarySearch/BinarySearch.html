<h1>Binary search</h1>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Consider the following sorted list of integers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]</p>
<p>We want to find the index of the number 7 in this list. Using the binary search algorithm, we would:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Compare the middle element, 5, to the search key, 7. Since 5 is less than 7, we know the search key must be in the right half of the list</li>
  <li>Repeating step 1 with the right half of the list [6, 7, 8, 9, 10], we find the middle element, 8, and compare it to 7. Since 8 is greater than 7, we know the search key must be in the left half of the list</li>
  <li>Repeating step 1 with the left half of the list [6, 7], we find the middle element, 6, and compare it to 7. Since 6 is less than 7, we know the search key must be in the right half of the list</li>
  <li>Repeating step 1 with the right half of the list [7], we find the middle element, 7, and compare it to 7. Since they are equal, we know we have found the search key, and its index in the list is 3</li>
</ol>
<h2>Algorithm</h2>
<pre>
procedure binary_search(arr, key, left, right)

:
if right >= left:
middle = left + (right - left) / 2
if arr[middle] == key:
return middle
elif arr[middle] > key:
return binary_search(arr, key, left, middle-1)
else:
return binary_search(arr, key, middle+1, right)
else:
return -1
</pre>
<p>Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. The algorithm begins by comparing the middle element of the list with the search key. If the middle element is equal to the search key, we have found the item and its index. If the middle element is greater than the search key, we know that the item must be in the left half of the list, and we repeat the process on the left half of the list. If the middle element is less than the search key, we know that the item must be in the right half of the list, and we repeat the process on the right half of the list. This process continues until the item is found or the list is exhausted. The time complexity of binary search is O(log n) which makes it more efficient than simple search (O(n)) which checks every element in the list. However, the list should be sorted before applying binary search to get the efficient results.
